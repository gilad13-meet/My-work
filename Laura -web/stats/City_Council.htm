				Wharton holds three portfolios -- the advancement of people with disabilities, the elderly, and public health -- and has devoted most of her political career to social justice. For the advancement of people with disabilities, Wharton saw to the creation of a municipal department for accessibility, passed a decision to recognize a standing advisory committee for the advancement for people with disabilities, established an annual prize for outstanding employers of people with disabilities, and numerous other initiatives. Wharton's proposal for the creation of a municipal Council for the Elderly won unanimous backing by the City Council and became a model for other Israeli cities; the Council for the Elderly, meets once a month and runs several sub-committees, including a forum for volunteer organizations serving the homebound, a committee for Holocaust survivors, a cultural activities committee, and others. In the field of public health, Wharton backed the opening of new clinics in East Jerusalem for mothers and infants and the improvement of these facilities city-wide.  She also worked to increase the budget for the city's veterinary services enabling a doubling of the number of operations for spaying and neutering stray cats.

				Wharton is an active feminist. She served on Jerusalem's Committee for the Advancement of Women and established together with Lily Ben-Ami (the Labor Party) and Edna Friedman (the National Religious Party) a city-wide Women's Forum. In addition, she ran a lecture series on workers' rights for Ultra-Orthodox working women and organized lectures for Arab girls in the framework of activities for International Women's Day. She was actively involved in the movement to abolish gender-separation on public transportation and successful won, together with other women, two Supreme Court appeals (represented by attorney Yifat Solel and Dr. Aviad Hacohen) requiring police intervention on behalf of women in Ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods. She was a leader of a women's rights march in Mea Shearim in Jerusalem and took part in numerous protests and initiatives on behalf of womens' rights.

				Fighting religious coercion, Ultra-Orthodox attempts at land-grabs, preferential treatment of the religious and ultra-religious in city services and budget allocations have also been major focuses of Wharton's work. These have been part of a policy of seeking equality among all of Jerusalem's populations.
